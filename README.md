## Documentation

[Rapaio](https://padreati.github.io/rapaio/) is a rich collection of data mining, statistics and machine learning tools
written completely in Java. Documentation for this library is hosted as [github pages](https://padreati.github.io/rapaio/).
Most of the documentation is written as Jupyter notebooks and hosted at 
[rapaio-notebooks github repository](https://github.com/padreati/rapaio-notebooks). The notebooks repository can also be 
spinned up through [binder]().

## Installation

Last published release on maven central is 2.4.0

       <dependency>

       </dependency>

The best way for exploration is through jupyter / jupyter-lab notebooks. 
This is excellent for experimenting with interactive notebooks or 
to document the ideas you are working on. 

You have to install jupyter / jupyter-lab and IJava kernel. For more information
you can follow the instruction from 
[IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava#installing). The following 
notation is specific to IJava kernel jupyter notation.
